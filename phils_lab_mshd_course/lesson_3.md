## PART SELECTION BASICS 

1. Choose the 'main' parts first. 
    - in this instance, the processor and the data converters. Ensure voltage requirements are 
    the same/similar as they can be. 

2. Choose power supplies **after** calculating power requirements (voltages and currents) of all relevant ICs/circuitry. 
    - power supplies need to handle **continuous** and **peak** currents at given input and output voltages. 

3. Choose additional components (resistors, capacitors, op-amps etc.) when designing 'surrounding' circuitry (for ICs).
- details usually given in datasheets and application notes. 

4. Choose specific connectors last. 
    - you know the general types beforehand but not the specific parts
